**Why are you applying for Financial Aid?** (150 words minimum required)

I'm a master student currently studying Information Technology at The University of Melbourne. I am supervised by my supervisor doing Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Network. I'm now doing my graduate project of Image Recognition. It's fascinating for me to learn on Coursera and apply the knowledge to applications and solve complex problems. Since it cost me more than $40000 AUD every year, it is too hard for me and my family to afford additional fees on other study resources. I have always been trying to save money and spend more energy and time on my studies, but it's very difficult for me to squeeze my wallet to pay more money on another course.

Although I don't have any income right now, I believe that I will repay Coursera in the future when I enter the workspace. I will be grateful and appreciate for Coursera for offering this financial aid.

## Data Processing

### Feature Scaling (特征缩放)

Make every feature into approximaltely a $$-1 \leq x_i \leq 1$$ range

### Mean Normalisation (均值归一化)

Replace $$x_i$$ with $$x_i - \mu_i$$ to make features have approximately zero mean

- optimize features on similar scales

- gradient descent goes straight to the minimum
- use larger steps with gradient descent
